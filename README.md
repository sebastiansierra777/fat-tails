## 🎯 Overview

This project analyzes the daily log-returns of major tech stocks: Palantir, Tesla, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. 
Using Python, I will build empirical histograms from these daily log-returns and compare them against their 
overlaid fitted normal distribution probability density functions, with the goal of contrasting the observed empirical results 
with theoretical expectations. In the end, these stocks will exhibit fat-tail behaviour that deviates from the Normal Distribution, 
supporting the views of Mandelbrot and Taleb on markets and finance.
